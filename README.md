#Practice Task of Basic Syntax, Variables and Data Types
---

1. Explain why we need long long int data type?
2. Write all the rules for naming a variable in C programming.
3. Write a C program that will take 2 numbers from the user and then print the 2nd number first and then first number.

Answer: 

1: We need the `long long int` data type when we need to store integer values that exceed the memory space of a regular `int`. Typically, a `long long int` uses 64 bits, which allows it to store much larger numbers compared to an `int` (which generally uses 32 bits).

2:-
 1. Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`)
 2. Can include letters, numbers, or underscores
 3. Cannot use C keywords like `int`, `return`, `if` as variable names
